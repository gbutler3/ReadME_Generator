# 09 Node.js Homework: Professional README Generator

## Task

Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). Review the [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.

## Directions

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
When I am prompted for information about my application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
When I enter my project title, this is displayed as the title of the README
When I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
When I choose a license for my application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
When I enter my GitHub username, this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
When I enter my email address, this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
